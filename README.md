# NeuronAstrocyteCounter

The following script had the aim of automatically quantify the percentage of neurons and astrocytes from ICC imaging. It is optimized for 10X and 20X images, however a bit of manual tuning of the detection threshold is needed for best personalized results.
The metodology is explained in more details in:
